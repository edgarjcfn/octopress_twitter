Twitter aside for Octopress
===========================

This plugin gives an aside for twitter for the [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) blogging framework.

It will display your latest tweets on the sidebar and will be updated everytime you build your blog.

Installation
------------
Download the source code and copy it into you octopress root, keeping the folder structure.

Usage
-----
1. Before using you should go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://dev.twitter.com/) and create a Twitter app. It's pretty straightforward.
2. After it's done, type in your app information in plugins/twitter.rb
3. Next, add the custom/asides/twitter.html to your _config.yml

That's it!

I made this aside on my very first day trying to use Octopress, so maybe I'm not following a few development patterns. Would love to get some feedback.
